We usually meet once a month at <a href="https://joinopenworks.com" title="101 North Main Street - aka the Bank of America building">OpenWorks</a> in downtown Greenville. If we're getting close to end of a project we might meet more frequently to get things done.

<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Upstate-Code-for-America/" title="Don't let the Upstate Code For name fool you. It's Code for GVL">Join our Meetup group to stay in loop for all meetings</a>
