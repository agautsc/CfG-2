####Events PI
This is Code for GVL's first project to get to prototype phase. Simply put, it's an API of all the tech organizations in the Greenville. The data, when possible, is updated automatically by using Meetup, EventBrite and other such APIs. Our goal is to have a suite of tools that can update organization and event information without having a person curate the database.

####Get Involved
