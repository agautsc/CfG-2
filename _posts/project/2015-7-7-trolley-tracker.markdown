####About the Trolley Tracker
Improving the transportation ecosystem of Greenville is a huge and important project
for the future growth of the city. It's the highest percentage of ideas on <a href="http://whatifgreenville.com" title="Ideas for a better Greenville">What If Greenville</a> by a large margin and the more you talk to people in all areas the more you realize how important good transportation is. You can have the best schools, jobs, hospitals, and grocery stores in the world, but if people can't get to them none of it matters.

This is why we decided to tackle the trolley tracker as one of our first projects. We thought creating an app to allow citizens to see where the free downtown trolley is would increase trolley ridership and be a nice, doable pilot project for additional transportation projects of the future.

This "small" project includes over 30 people working on 5 distinct apps. We've developed

* Android beacon to track the trolley
* A web, iOS, Android and Windows client app to allow individuals to see where the trolleys are and how long people need to wait until the trolley arrives.
* Data storage and an API to manage all this
* Admin area to manage new trolleys, stops and routes
